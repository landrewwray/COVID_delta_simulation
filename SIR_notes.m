% 1. create population groups (cells)
%    -population
%    -R-value (Gaussian distribution? Voigt?)
%    -s,i,r/immune
% 2. create cross-infection matrix
%    -flat?
%    -random
% 3. -create time propagation function
% 
% Regimes of interest:
% 1. extended tail in decay.
%    -in a simple SIR model
%    -in a quenched model, where there's initial growth, followed by setting <R> < 1, while Reff~1
% 2. superdiffusion upon variant introduction
%    -start in the quenched state, with no cases, <R><0 and and a potential Reff>1.
%       -seed continuously from an external bath. (need probabilistic case number transfer)
